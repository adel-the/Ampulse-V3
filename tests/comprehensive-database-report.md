## DETAILED RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS

### 1. Hotel ‚Üí Rooms (One-to-Many)
```sql
-- Working relationship verified:
SELECT h.nom, r.numero, r.type, r.prix 
FROM hotels h 
LEFT JOIN rooms r ON h.id = r.hotel_id
```
- ‚úÖ Foreign key: `rooms.hotel_id ‚Üí hotels.id`
- ‚úÖ CASCADE DELETE: Deleting hotel removes all associated rooms
- ‚úÖ Constraint enforcement: Cannot create room without valid hotel

### 2. Hotel ‚Üê ‚Üí Equipment (Many-to-Many)
```sql
-- Junction table: hotel_equipments
SELECT h.nom, e.nom, he.est_gratuit, he.prix_supplement
FROM hotels h
JOIN hotel_equipments he ON h.id = he.hotel_id
JOIN equipments e ON he.equipment_id = e.id
```
- ‚úÖ Junction table properly configured
- ‚úÖ Foreign keys: `hotel_id ‚Üí hotels.id`, `equipment_id ‚Üí equipments.id`
- ‚úÖ Unique constraint: `(hotel_id, equipment_id)`
- ‚úÖ Additional properties: availability, pricing, conditions

### 3. Room ‚Üê ‚Üí Equipment (Many-to-Many)
```sql
-- Junction table: room_equipments  
SELECT r.numero, e.nom, re.est_fonctionnel, re.date_installation
FROM rooms r
JOIN room_equipments re ON r.id = re.room_id  
JOIN equipments e ON re.equipment_id = e.id
```
- ‚úÖ Junction table properly configured
- ‚úÖ Foreign keys: `room_id ‚Üí rooms.id`, `equipment_id ‚Üí equipments.id`
- ‚úÖ Unique constraint: `(room_id, equipment_id)`
- ‚úÖ Additional properties: functionality status, maintenance dates

## COMPLEX QUERY SCENARIOS TESTED

### 1. Complete Hotel Profile
Successfully retrieved hotel with all associated data in a single query:
- Basic hotel information
- All rooms with their details
- Hotel-level equipment with pricing
- Room-specific equipment with status

### 2. Room Equipment Inheritance
Verified that rooms can access both:
- Hotel-level equipment (shared facilities like WiFi, pool)
- Room-specific equipment (in-room TV, minibar)

### 3. Occupancy Analytics
Real-time calculation of:
- Total rooms per hotel
- Available/occupied/maintenance counts
- Occupancy rates by hotel
- System-wide statistics

### 4. Equipment Distribution Analysis
Comprehensive equipment analytics:
- Equipment count by category (connectivity, services, wellness, etc.)
- Premium vs standard equipment distribution
- Installation tracking across hotels and rooms
- Availability status monitoring

---

## DATA CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION

### ‚úÖ Successful Tests

1. **Equipment Sharing**: Single equipment item (WiFi) successfully shared between multiple rooms while maintaining separate configuration per room.

2. **Update Consistency**: Room status changes properly update all related fields and timestamps.

3. **Timestamp Integrity**: Automatic `updated_at` triggers work correctly on all tables.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issue

**Orphan Record Prevention**: Using service role key bypasses some RLS policies. In production with proper user authentication, this would be properly enforced.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority
1. **Review RLS Policies**: Ensure orphan record prevention works with proper user authentication in production

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Performance Monitoring**: Implement query performance tracking for production
2. **Consider Connection Pooling**: For high-concurrent environments
3. **Add Data Validation Triggers**: Additional business rule enforcement at database level

### Low Priority
1. **Add Audit Triggers**: Track data changes for compliance
2. **Implement Soft Deletes**: Consider logical deletion for critical entities
